## Overview

This project is a **Minesweeper game implemented in Assembly (x86)**.  
It was developed to explore **low-level programming**, memory management, and game logic using assembly language instructions.

The main goal was to recreate the classic **Minesweeper** mechanics — revealing cells, placing flags, and avoiding hidden mines — while gaining a deeper understanding of how logic and data structures work at the processor level.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Practice **x86 Assembly** instructions and syntax.  
- Understand **registers, stack operations, and memory management**.  
- Implement game logic using **conditional jumps and loops**.  
- Work with **input/output routines** for a simple terminal-based interface.

## 🧩 Features

- Random generation of mines.  
- Ability to mark and reveal cells.  
- Win/lose condition detection.  
- Command-line interaction.
